O5. Percentage Project Campus Director Applications
We are excited to announce that the Percentage Project is recruiting our next cohort of Campus
Directors for the 2024-2025 campaign cycle!
The Percentage Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to helping every
person of every background embrace their diversity and feel a sense of belonging in the
field that they pursue. For the past 4 years, we have worked with several colleges in the
US (such as Harvard, UPenn, Brown, University of Vermont, Rutgers, and Northwestern)
to highlight what it's like being an underrepresented minority studying technology-
related fields using data-driven advocacy. We do this by distributing an anonymous survey,
organizing the statistics, and showcasing the data insights through student-led projects (ie. a gallery
of student portrait photos). This year, we added NEW projects such as "Story Behind the Stat" video
interview and diversity roadmap projects. We have also expanded our partnerships with student
organizations, such as with the Northwestern chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional
Engineers.
